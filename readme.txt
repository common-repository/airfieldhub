== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an AirfieldHub account? =

Should you wish to accept payments through AirfieldHub, you will be required to link your AirfieldHub account with a Stripe account. This is done from your AirfieldHub Dashboard!

= I have an older version of WordPress, can I still use this plugin? =

NO. Unfortunately, this plugin relies on the new templating engine that WordPress has developped, as such we have not tested it on anything below version 5.9 - Should you wish to get setup on previous version of WordPress, you will find our widget in your AirfieldHub Dashboard, depending on which version of WordPress you have, you should be able to copy and paste this code into all older versions of WordPress without issue.
